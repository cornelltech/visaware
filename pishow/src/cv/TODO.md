## TODO.md

No order of importance, just a place to jot down a wish list of TODO items.

* DRY the code - use a VideoStream ABS that implements start(), stop(), read()
  but forces you to implement main_thread() (the constructor is unique too)
* FPS:
  a) if fps supplied is 0 it means go as fast as you can
  b) DRY it
