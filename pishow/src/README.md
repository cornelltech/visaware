## visaware/pishow/src/

This directory contains all source code running on the pishow board
for the visaware project.

The source code here relies on another repository. Clone it
first, at the same parent folder of the current repository
(same folder where you cloned the current repository) -
this will make the symbolic links here point to the
proper paths:
```
    git clone (https://github.com/cornelltech/opencv-video-loops)[https://github.com/cornelltech/opencv-video-loops]
```
